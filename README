Export the EI you want to build (if it not already built) to
a "build" directory.  The default is /usr/local/mgi/ei/ei_build.

Note that exporting the EI is NOT an installation of the EI!!!

cd /usr/local/mgi/ei/ei_build
cvs export -r ei-tag -d ei-tag ei
cd ei-tag
cp Configuration.default Configuration
edit Configuration file carefully and appropriately
