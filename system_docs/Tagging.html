Tagging a Release
</H2>

Production releases of the EI are tagged with tags of the form "eiM-N", 
where M is the Major release number and N is the minor release number. 
Development releases can have "aX" or "bX" appended to the last Production
tag, depending on whether the release is an alpha or beta release (where
'a' and 'b' are literals and "X" is any positive integer >=0).
Patch releases are maintained on a separate branch, "eiM-N-patches", and 
are tagged with the suffix "pX".
