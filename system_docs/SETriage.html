<H2>SE Triage Procedures</H2>

<H4>Introduction</H4>

This document describes the procedures for determining what action to take
on SE Triage requests which are routed to the SE Triage person through WTS.
<P>

<H4>Initiating an SE Triage Request</H4>
SE Triage requests are initiated by a user submitting a WTS tracking record and
routing the request to "SE triage".  This is the default routing for all requests
for which the user cannot determine a more specific category.
<P>
When the submitter clicks <I>Save</I> in either the WTS New Tracking Record Long or Short form,
an email is automatically sent to the designated SE Triage person with the WTS tracking number
and the title of the request.
<P>
For the scope of this document, a <I>request</I> is defined as:
	<UL>
	<LI>a suggestion for a new enhancement to the system
	<LI>a bug report
	<LI>a question regarding usage of a particular part of the system
	<LI>basically, anything the user enters into WTS
	</UL>

<H4>SE Triage Account</H4>
WTS will route "SE triage" requests to the user account "setriage".  To access the mail
for this account:
<OL>
<LI>Logon to host <CODE>titan</CODE>
<LI>Use <CODE>pine</CODE> to read the mail.
<LI>Save all incoming messages to the default folder <CODE>saved-messages</CODE>.
<LI>All sent mail will automatically be saved to the folder <CODE>sent-mail</CODE>.
</OL>
<P>
Contact the System Administrator if you need access to this account and do not know the
password.

<H4>Role of the SE Triage Person</H4>
The SE Triage person's role is to gain as much information about the request as possible in order 
to route the tracking record to the most appropriate Area/Staff person to handle the request.
<P>
The main tasks of the SE Triage person are:
<OL>
<LI>To analyze the request to determine to which specific Area the request belongs.  This will
    involve communicating with the person who submitted the request to obtain more details
    about the request.  The SE Triage person may need to update the WTS tracking record to
    flesh out any details not included in the initial report of the request.
    It is helpful to include (where applicable):
    <P>
	<UL>
	<LI>The platform the user is using (UNIX, MAC)
	<LI>The database/server the user is using (Production, Development, Public, etc.)
	<LI>The Web browser (Netscape, Internet Explorer, etc.)
	<LI>The specific Web form, URL
	<LI>The specific Editing interface form 
	<LI>The specific record or query
	<LI>Any error messages which the user received.
	</UL>
   <P>
   The SE Triage person does not have to write a novel, but should give enough information for
   the next person in the process to be able to understand the request without having to re-contact
   the user and repeat information gathering.
<P>
<LI>To check WTS for previous reports of the same or similar requests.  If the request is
    similar or the same as a previous request, then
	<UL>
        <LI>The SE Triage person refers the user to the existing WTS record which addresses
	    the same request.
	<LI>The SE Triage person cancels the new WTS record and refers to the exisiting WTS record
	    which addresses the same request.
	</UL>
    <P>
    It is up to the discretion of the SE Triage person as to whether the new WTS request is unique
    enough to justify the new tracking record, or is similar enough to an existing tracking record
    to be cancelled.  The existing tracking record can be modified to show that subsequent reports
    of similar substance have been submitted.
<P>
<LI>To determine the specific category to which the request belongs:
	<UL>
	<LI>The SE Triage person can forward a TR to the appropriate Area by editing the
	    tracking record and selecting the appropriate <CODE>Forward TR</CODE> category.
	    This will automatically add the appropriate Staff person(s) to the TR record, but
	    will NOT remove the SE Triage person from the Staff field.  You must manually
	    remove the SE Triage person from the tracking record.
	<LI>Modify the Type field of the WTS record, if needed.
	<LI>Enter a Progress Note annotating the forwarding of the WTS record to the new Area.
	</UL>
<P>
<LI>In some instances, the SE Triage person may determine that the request reported does not require
    routing to another Area.  That is, the request may be a usage or data entry problem.  
    If the SE Triage person determines that this is the case <B>and</B> is able to solve the problem 
    without the aid of another SE, then the SE Triage person:
	<UL>
	<LI>Corresponds with the submitter to resolve the problem.
	<LI>Annotates the WTS record with the resolution.
	<LI>Statuses the WTS record as <I>done</I>.
	</UL>
</OL>
