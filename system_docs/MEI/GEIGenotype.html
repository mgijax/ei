<H4>Introduction</H4>
 
<P>
An expression assay is defined as a group of expression-related facts reported in a
single reference, having a single type (e.g. Western blot), measuring the expression of
a single gene and using a single probe.  Within one assay, expression may be measured
among different animals (having different genotypes and/or ages) and within different tissues.
<P>
If an assay is a Gel Assay (e.g. Northern), the the assay record corresponds to the gel itself.
<P>
If an assay is an In Situ (e.g. Immunohistochemistry), then the assay record corresponds to a
somewhat abstract grouping of the animals and results for a single probe.
<P>
If a Gel or In Situ assay uses multiple probes, then it is split into separate assays when it
is entered into the database.
<P>
Each Assay contains a nucleotide probe preparation record or an antibody preparation record.
A probe (nucleotide or antibody) used in an assay is "prepared" by attaching a radioactive
label to it so that it can be detected, e.g. by autoradiography.

<LI>The only Genotype records returned by a <I>Search</I> are those Genotypes records
    which are cross-referenced by the currently selected Assay record in the Assay module
    (if there is one) and those Genotype records which are not cross-referenced by any Assay.

<LI>When a Genotype record is <I>Added</I> to the database, the Genotype record is
    automatically added to the <I>Genotype Clipboard</I>.
