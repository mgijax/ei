MGD EDITING INTERFACE: Design and Requirements - Homology
</H2>
<BR>

<H4>Introduction</H4>
Homology defines relationships of genes among different mammalian species.  This interface allows the
user to define a Homology reported in a specific Reference.  Once that Homology has been entered, the
interface will attempt to merge that Homology with other Homologies which have at least one of the
symbol/species pairs in common.  This creates a Homology "class" thru transitivity:

	<PRE>
	If Mouse A is homologous to Human A and Human A is homologus to Rat A, 
	then Mouse A is homologous to Rat A
	</PRE>

<P>
Homologies are defined by the Assay(s) which were used to determine the homology.  Therefore, one
Reference may report 3 different homologous relationships using 3 different assays.  The 3 homologies
may fall under the same homology "class", or they may not.
<P>
In this interface, it is important to remember that one selected record is equivalent to one defined homology and
not an entire homology class.
<P>
Downloads from Species-specific databases are used to update the Symbol attributes for non-mouse species on
a regular basis (<A HREF="MEIHomologyLoad.html">MGI Homology Loads</A>).

<H4>Accession Numbers</H4>
<OL>
<LI>MGI:; system-generated

<H4>Data Verifications</H4>
<OL>
<LI>Species (see <A HREF="MEI.html#dataVerOption">Data Verifications section on Option Menus</A>)
<P>
<LI>Assays (see <A HREF="MEI.html#dataVerLookup">Data Verifications section on Lookup Lists</A>)

</OL>

<H4>Fields</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Required
	<OL>
	<LI>J:
	<LI>Species
	<LI>Symbol
	<LI>Chr
	<LI>Name
	<LI>Assay
	</OL>
<P>
<LI>Not Required
	<OL>
	<LI>Cyto

	</OL>
</UL>

<H4>Defaults</H4>
The Marker table <B>always</B> displays the following species:
<OL>
<LI>mouse, laboratory
<LI>human
<LI>rat
</OL>

When a homology record is displayed, all of the default species plus all of the species
defined in the homology are displayed.  If no Symbol is associated with a default species,
then that species is not part of the homology record.
<P>
Default species values cannot be overwritten by any other species value.  The row of a
default species value is reserved solely for that species.

<H4>Searches</H4>
All fields in the editing form are searchable with the following exceptions:
<OL>
<LI>Numbered columns in the Marker table
<LI>Numbered columns in the Assay table
</OL>

<H4>Deletions</H4>
There are no restrictions on deleting a Homology.

<H4>Modifying Symbols</H4>
Symbols for mouse can only be modified using the Marker form.
<P>
Symbols for non-mouse species can be modified/added by entering the Species/Symbol in the
Symbol table and tabbing.  If the Species/Symbol does not exist in the database, the user
will be informed that this Species/Symbol will be added during the next modification/add 
of the Homology record.
<P>
If the Species/Symbol does exist, then the Chr, Cyto, Name, AccID will be displayed.  The
user can modify any of these values for a non-mouse species, and these changes will be
be propagated to all Homology records which refer to that Species/Symbol.
<P>
There is currently no way for a user to modify a non-mouse species symbol of an existing record.

<H4>Adding/Modifying a Homology</H4>
<OL>
<LI>Enter all of the Species/Symbols in the Symbol table.
<P>
<LI>Select all of the Assays which are used in defining the homologies for the Symbols.
<P>
<LI>Enter all of the Notes which are available.
<P>
<LI>Select the Symbol/Assay combinations which define each homology by clicking in the
    Assay column which corresponds to the <I>No.</I> column of the Symbol.
<P>
<LI>A Species/Symbol can belong to more than one Assay group, but must belong to at least one
    Assay group or else it will be dropped from the homology.  Therefore, to delete a Symbol 
    from a homology, de-select the Symbol from the Assay to which it is attached.
    <P>
    If a new Assay is to be assigned to a pre-existing Homology, insert the new Assay
    adjacent to the pre-existing Homology.  This will ensure that the Assay groups are
    assigned to the same Homology key.
<P>
<LI>After any add/modification, the system will attempt to "merge" the current homology record
    with other homologies which belong to the same "class", based on the Symbols/Species defined.
<P>
<LI>As Species/Symbol are entered in the Symbol table, the system will detect any collisions,
    i.e. the entry of a Species/Symbol which conflicts with a previously defined homology.
    <P>
    For example, if a homology class exists for <I>mouse, Ren1</I> and <I>human, REN</I> and
    the user attempts to enter <I>mouse, Ren1</I> and <I>human, REN1</I> and the symbol
    <I>human, REN1</I> exists in the database, then the system will detect a conflict and 
    report this to the user.
    <P>
    <B>However</B>, if the symbol <I>human, REN1</I> does <B>not</B> exist in the database,
    then the symbol is added and the modification <I>is</I> allowed.  This "back door" may
    need to be shut at some point in time.
<P>
<LI>If a Species/Symbol needs to be replaced with a differenct symbol for a given Homology Class,
    then the entire Homology Class must be deleted and re-added.
<P>
</OL>

<H4>Notes</H4>
Homology notes are attached to unique homology records.  A unique homology record is defined
by the Species to which the Assay is assigned.
<P>
At the present time, the user cannot attach notes to a specific homology reference or to a
specific homology marker symbol.

<H4>Miscellaneous</H4>
<OL>
<LI>Setting the <I>Display Inferred Homologies</I> ON before a <I>Search</I> will retrieve all
    Homology records belonging to the same Homology Class of the Homology record which matches
    the user's search criteria.
    <P>
    For example, searching for <I>mouse, laboratory/Ren1</I> with the toggle OFF will retrieve
    8 Homology records where <I>mouse, laboratory/Ren1</I> is a member of each Homology record.
    <P>
    Searching for <I>mouse, laboratory/Ren1</I> with the toggle ON will retrieve all of the
    16 Homology records which belong to the Homology Class of which <I>mouse, laboratory/Ren1</I>
    is a member.  <I>mouse, laboratory/Ren1</I> will not necessarily be a member of every
    Homology record which is retrieved, however.
<P>
<LI>The <I>Class ID</I> for every Homology record is displayed for the user.  The user can also
    search for a specific <I>Class ID</I>.  However, <I>Class IDs</I> are assigned by the system
    and cannot be modified by the user.
<P>
<LI>Certain Species' Symbols are updated from data downloads of species-specific databases.
    Refer to <A HREF="MEIHomologyLoad.html">MGI Homology Loads</A> for a complete 
    description of how this data is used to update Symbols and Accession numbers in MGD.
