<H2>MGI: Marker Transfer Report</H2>

<H4>Introduction</H4>

The Marker Transfer Report tells the user which datasets are involved in a transfer
from one Marker Symbol/J: pair to another symbol.  This process does not actually 
transfer any data.

<H4>Initiating the Marker Transfer Report</H4>

A Marker Transfer Report is initiated from the MGD Editorial Interface's Marker form using the 
<A HREF="markertransfer.gif"><I>Utilities->Marker Transfer Report</I></A> menu item in the top 
menu bar.

The user is required to enter:
<OL>
