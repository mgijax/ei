<H4>Introduction</H4>
 
(This information has been extracted from the GXD Schema document) 
<P>
An image is associated with a reference and figure number within the reference, describes its format
and (x,y) dimensions.  An image may have a caption and/or a legend.
<P>
In a publication, images are usually grouped into panels, where each panel is one figure.  Individual
images within a panel are referred to as "panes".  Panes are usually labelled A, B, C, etc.  One
scanning operation captures the entire panel.  One figure (panel) in a reference equals one image
in the database.
<P>
Actual images (pixels) are not stored in MGI but are stored in the Pixel Image Database and 
referenced by a Pixel Image Accession number.
