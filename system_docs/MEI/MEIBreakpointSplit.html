<H2>MGI: Breakpoint Split</H2>

<H4>Introduction</H4>

The Breakpoint Split process allows the user to split a chromosomal aberration
(inversion, insertion, deletion, dupliation) which
has identified more than one breakpoint within one chromosome into two distinct symbols.
Refer to <A HREF="http://prodwww/wts/searches/tr.detail.cgi?TR_Nr=120">TR#120</A> for 
further information and detailed requirements of the split process.

<H4>Initiating the Split</H4>
Before a Breakpoint Split is initiated, the user should review the Editorial procedure for
Breakpoint Splits.
<P>
The user should also verify with Lori Corbani or John Gilbert that she/he has permissions to 
update all of the data sets involved in the split process.  If the user does not have all 
of the necessary permissions, then data inconsistency will result.
<OL>
<LI>Marker
</OL>

A Breakpoint Split is initiated from the MGD Editorial Interface's Marker form using the 
<A HREF="breakpointsplit.gif"><I>Utilities->Breakpoint Split</I></A>
menu item in the top menu bar.
<P>
The user is required to enter:
<OL>
<LI>Original Marker Symbol
</OL>

After the user enters the Marker Symbol and TABS:
<OL>
<LI>The Cytogenetic Band of the Marker symbol is displayed.
<P>
<LI>The new proximal and distal symbols which will be created are displayed.
<P>
<LI>The proximal and distal bands are displayed.  If no distal band is displayed,
    then the user can enter the distal band value to be assigned to the distal symbol.
<P>
<LI>If the Marker symbol entered is not valid, then the user cannot process the split.
    <P>
    The message:
	<PRE>
	Invalid Symbol.  Must be an inversion, deletion, duplication or insertion.
	</PRE>
    indicates that the Marker symbol is of invalid type for this operation.
    <P>
    The message:
	<PRE>
	Mouse Symbol 'symbol'
	Invalid Symbol
	</PRE>
    indicates that the Marker symbol does not exist in the database.
<P>
<LI>The user clicks the <I>Process Split</I> button to process the split.
<P>
<LI>The user clicks the <I>Done</I> button to return to the main Marker form.
</OL>

<H4>What the Breakpoint Split process does</H4>
<OL>
<LI>The original symbol's cytogenetic band is parsed into two bands if the original band 
    is in the format:  <I>band1</I> & <I>band2</I>.
    <P>
    If the original marker symbol's cytogenetic band is <B>not</B> in this format, then
    <I>band1</I> is set to the original symbol's cytogenetic band and <I>band2</I> is set 
    to NULL unless the user enters a specific value.  If left to NULL, the user must manually 
    edit the <I>band2</I> value after the split has been processed.
<P>
<LI>The original symbol is split into two symbols:
        <UL>
        <LI><I>band1</I> is assigned to the proximal (-p) symbol.
            <BR>The original MGI Accession number is retained for this symbol and all 
                associated information (Marker, Mapping, References) is retained with 
                this symbol.
        <LI><I>band2</I> is assigned to the distal (-d) symbol.
            <BR>A new MGI Accession number is to be assigned for this symbol and all
                associated Marker information is copied from
                the proximal record to the new distal record.
        </UL>
   <P>
   The end result is two symbol records which are identical except for their symbol,
   cytogenetic offset and MGI Accession number.  In some instances, the cM offset may
   need to be modified for either or both symbols after the split is processed.
<P>
<LI>Creates an <I>Other Name</I> entry of the original symbol for both the proximal and distal symbols.
    For example, Del(1)27H will become an <I>Other Name</I> for Del(1)27H-p and Del(1)27H-d.
<P>
<LI>All edits to Mapping data must be handled <B>manually</B> by the Mapping Editor.
</OL>

<H4>Manual Edits After the Split</H4>
It will be necessary to manually edit some information after the split has been processed:
<OL>
<LI>The band information for the distal symbol may need to be modified.  If the original
    symbol's band information is not in the format <I>band1</I> & <I>band2</I>, then the
    band for the distal symbol is set to NULL by the split process unless the user enters
    a value in the Broadcast Split dialog before initiating the split.
<P>
<LI>Mapping information for proximal symbols will need to be reviewed and modified by
    the Mapping Editor.  The mapping data may or may not define the proximal or distal marker. 
    An experiment may map a deletion to Chromosome 5, but it is not mapping a breakpoint, thus 
    effectively assigning both proximal and distal markers to the chromosome. Or, an experiment 
    may map one end of the deletion and apply to only one of the new markers. 
</OL>

<H4>Output from the Breakpoint Split</H4>

The breakpoint split process outputs two files per symbol split.  These files are:
<OL>
<LI>Output to the user's <CODE>$HOME/mgireport</CODE> directory 
<LI>Archived at <CODE>titan:/usr/local/mgi/ei/mgd/mgireport/SPLITS</CODE> where they are
    available from the <A HREF="http://kelso:4444/qcr.html">Quality Control Reports</A> page.
</OL>

The output files are:
<OL>
<LI><I>&lt;breakpointSplit&gt;&lt;original symbol&gt;.diagnostics</I>
    <P>Diagnostic listing of all SQL generated during processing.
       This file is for SEs to debug any problems.
<P>
<LI><I>&lt;breakpointSplit&gt;&lt;original symbol&gt;.status</I>
     <P>Status file of breakpoint split.  This file
	informs the user of when the split was processed and what
	records were involved in the split.
	<P>
	The status report is mailed to:
	<UL>
	<LI>The initiator of the split
	<LI>Lois Maltais (Nomenclature Coordinator)
	<LI>Dirck Bradt (Mapping Editor)
	<LI>John Gilbert (DBA/Chromosome Committee Offset updates)
	</UL>
     <P>An example status report:

	Subject: Breakpoint Split In(15)18Rk
 
	This message has been automatically forwarded to you by the
