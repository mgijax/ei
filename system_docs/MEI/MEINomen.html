MGD EDITING INTERFACE: Design and Requirements - Nomenclature
</H2>
<BR>

<H4>Introduction</H4>
The Nomen DB is used by the MGI informatics group to enter novel and reserved mouse gene
symbols and to broadcast these symbols to MGD.
<P>
Refer to <A HREF="http://titan/wts_projects/1200/1291/userrequirements.pdf">TR 1291 Requirements</A>
for more information.

<H4>Accession Numbers</H4>
<OL>
<LI>EC, cross reference to Enzyme Commission number at ExPASy
<LI>Sequence, cross reference to GenBank, EMBL, DDBJ (nucleotide sequences)

<H4>Data Verifications</H4>
<OL>
<LI>Event (see <A HREF="MEI.html#dataVerOption">Data Verifications section on Option Menus</A>)
	<UL>
	<LI>The event <I>withdrawal</I> is not valid during an add or modification.  However, 
	    this value is used for historical data and entries exist which use this assignment
	    value.
	</UL>
<P>
<LI>Status (see <A HREF="MEI.html#dataVerOption">Data Verifications section on Option Menus</A>)
	<UL>
	<LI>Pending; the symbol has not been approved by the Mouse Nomenclature Committee
	<LI>Deleted; the symbol has been removed from the Nomenclature process
	<LI>Reserved; the symbol has been reserved for the Author and is not to be publicized
	<LI>Approved; the symbol has been approved by the Mouse Nomenclature Committee
	    and is ready to broadcast to MGD
	<LI>Broadcast; the symbol has been transferred to MGD
	</UL>
<P>
<LI>J Numbers (see <A HREF="MEI.html#dataVerJnumber">Data Verifications section on J Numbers</A>)
<P>
<LI>Markers
	<UL>
	<LI>If the Marker symbol exists in MGD or Nomen, then a warning is displayed to the user.  
	    Modifications allowed.
	<LI>If the Marker symbol exists in MGD with the "-pending" suffix,
	    then a warning is displayed to the user.  Modifications allowed.
	</UL>
<P>
<LI>Marker Type (see <A HREF="MEI.html#dataVerOption">Data Verifications section on Option Menus</A>)
<P>
<LI>Chromosome (see <A HREF="MEI.html#dataVerOption">Data Verifications section on Option Menus</A>)
	<UL>
	<LI>Chromosome <I>W</I> and <I>RE</I> are not valid during an add or modification.  However, 
	    these values are used for historical data and entries exist which use these assignment
	    values.
	</UL>
<P>
<LI>Submitted By <I>and</I> Broadcast By 
    (see <A HREF="MEI.html#dataVerOption">Data Verifications section on Option Menus</A>)
    <P>
    These option menus are dynamically created from the Nomenclature database <I>sysusers</I> table. 
    To be added to the lists:
	<UL>
	<LI>Contact John Gilbert (DBA) and request a Sybase login (if you do not already have one).
	<LI>Contact Lori Corbani (SE) and ask to be included in the lists (this involves a modification
	    to the Nomen User view and permissions on stored procedures).
	</UL>
    <P>
    The <I>retired_editors</I> user has been assigned to all historical data migrated from the
    original FileMaker Pro database, since this database did not track the submitter information.
    The <I>retired_editors</I> user cannot be selected for new entries and is only used in reference
    to migrated data.
    <P>
    Inactive logins (editors who have left the group) must still be available for searching and
    retrieving data, but are invalid for new entries.
    <P>
<P>
<LI>Gene Family (see <A HREF="MEI.html#dataVerLookup">Data Verifications section on Lookup Lists</A>)
<P>
<LI>Dates (see <A HREF="MEI.html#dataVerDate">Data Verifications section on Dates</A>)
	<UL>
	<LI>Broadcast Date
	</UL>
<P>
<LI>Review? (see <A HREF="MEI.html#dataVerOption">Data Verifications section on Option Menus</A>)
    <P>
    Modifying this value will set the "Is Review Article?" flag in the MGD Master Bib record
    of the reference.
<P>
<LI>Broadcast? (see <A HREF="MEI.html#dataVerOption">Data Verifications section on Option Menus</A>)
    <P>
    If <I>Yes</I>, then the reference will be loaded into MGD during a broadcast.  If <I>No</I>,
    then the reference will not be loaded into MGD during a broadcast.  The <I>Primary</I> reference
    is <I>always</I> broadcast to MGD.

<H4>Defaults</H4>
<OL>
<LI>Event; default is <I>assigned</I>
<LI>Status; default is <I>Pending</I>
<LI>Submitted by; default is current user
<LI>Broadcast by; default is current user when user broadcasts symbol
<LI>Broadcast Date = today when user broadcasts symbol
<LI>Reference Broadcast? = <I>Yes</I>.  The primary reference is always broadcast.
</OL>

<H4>Duplicates</H4>
(Remember:  Our database server is case-insensitive)
<OL>
<LI><I>Other Names</I> duplicates are disallowed.  Therefore, you cannot
    enter both <I>DokR</I> and <I>Dokr</I> as <I>Other Names</I>.  Only
    one of these values is allowed.
</OL>

<H4>Broadcasts to MGD</H4>
(Note:  Refer to <A HREF="http://titan/wts_projects/1200/1291/userrequirements.pdf">TR 1291 Requirements</A>
for definitions of Tier 3 and Tier 4 users and more details on each type of Broadcast.)
<P>
Tier 3 users can only broadcast symbols which they have submitted and which
have a status of <I>Pending</I>.  Tier 4 users may broadcast any symbol <B>except</B>
a symbol with a status of <I>Broadcast</I> or <I>Deleted</I>.
<P>
For a <I>batch</I> broadcast, if any errors are detected during the broadcast, the
entire batch fails and no symbols will be broadcast.
<P>
For the <I>add and broadcast</I>, if any errors are detected during the broadcast,
the symbol will still be added to Nomen.
<P>
When a broadcast to MGD is successful, the <I>Status</I>, <I>Broadcast by</I>,
<I>Broadcast Date</I>, and <I>MGI Accession ID</I> fields are automatically populated.  No
user can edit these fields manually.
<P>
<OL>
<LI><I>Add and Broadcast to MGD</I> - add symbol to Nomen and broadcast to MGD in one step
<LI><I>Broadcast by Symbol to MGD</I> - broadcast one symbol to MGD
<LI><I>Broadcast by Batch to MGD</I> - broadcast all <I>Approved</I> symbols to MGD (Tier 4 only)
<LI><I>Broadcast by Reference to MGD</I> - broadcast all <I>Pending</I> (if Tier 3) or
	<I>Approved</I> (if Tier 4) symbols which contain the specified <I>primary reference</I>
	to MGD
</OL>

<H4>Miscellaneous</H4>
<OL>
<LI>When the user adds either a <I>Primary</I> or <I>Related</I> Reference, the MGD Master 
    Bibliography record for that Reference will be updated so that the <I>Nomenclature</I> data 
    set is selected.
<P>
<LI>The <I>Symbol/Name Search</I> field is used for querying only.  When the user enters a value into
    this field and clicks <I>Search</I>, the system will take the search criteria entered and search
    the <I>Symbol</I> and <I>Name</I> fields for the value.  Search criteria entered in other form 
    fields are ignored when the <I>Symbol/Name Search</I> field is populated.
    <P>
    The search fields for <I>Symbol/Name Search</I> can be expanded to include Names and/or Notes.
<P>
<LI>To duplicate a record, select the record you want to duplicate and then de-select it.  All of
    the data fields <I>except</I> Other Names, Accession Numbers, Editor's Notes and Nomenclature
    Coordinator Notes will remain populated.
    Make the changes necessary for the <I>new</I> record and click <I>Add</I>.  
    The new record will be added.
