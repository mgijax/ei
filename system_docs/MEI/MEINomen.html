MGD EDITING INTERFACE: Design and Requirements - Nomenclature
</H2>
<BR>

<H4>Introduction</H4>
The Nomen DB is used by the MGI informatics group to enter novel and reserved mouse gene
symbols and to broadcast these symbols to MGD.
<P>

	<UL>
	<LI>Broadcast - Official; the symbol has been approved by Mouse Genomic Nomenclature Committee (MGNC) and/or
	    the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) and transferred to MGD as an "official" symbol.
	<P>
	<LI>Broadcast - Interim; the symbol has not been approved by MGNC or HGNC at the time it was transferred to MGD.
	    Symbol is temporary and awaiting further review until an official symbol is assigned.  This allows data
	    to be associated with the symbol and entered into MGI in a timely fashion.
	<P>
	<LI>In Progess; the symbol is awaiting additional work by curator or confirmation from HGNC, authors
	    or community experts.
	<P>
	<LI>Reserved; the symbol has been approved by MGNC and is to be kept confidential/private until publication
	    of the paper or author/MGNC/HGNC requests that it be released.
	<P>
	<LI>Approved; the symbol is a <B>locus</B> that was "reserved" or "in progress" and is
	    now in MGI as either the same symbol or a different symbol. The symbol should never
	    be broadcast to MGI since it already exists in MGI.
	<P>
	<LI>Deleted; the symbol is no longer needed for inclusion in MGI.  The data associated with the symbol
	    is needed for possible future use.  Generally this is a reserved symbol, though it may have been a symbol
	    in MGI that has been deleted in MGI.
	<P>
	<LI>Unreviewed; a BC###### symbol that was entered into Nomen via the LocusLink/MGC processing.  The data
	    associated with this symbol have not been reviewed by a curator.

<LI>J Numbers (see <A HREF="MEI.html#dataVerJnumber">Data Verifications section on J Numbers</A>)

<LI>Markers
	<UL>
	<LI>If the Marker symbol exists in MGD or Nomen, then a warning is displayed to the user.  
	    Modifications allowed.
	<LI>If the Marker symbol exists in MGD with the "-pending" suffix,
	    then a warning is displayed to the user.  Modifications allowed.
	</UL>
<P>
<LI>Marker Type (see <A HREF="MEI.html#dataVerPulldown">Data Verifications section on Pulldown Menus</A>)
<P>
<LI>Chromosome (see <A HREF="MEI.html#dataVerPulldown">Data Verifications section on Pulldown Menus</A>)
	<UL>
	<LI>Chromosome <I>W</I> and <I>RE</I> are not valid during an add or modification.  However, 
	    these values are used for historical data and entries exist which use these assignment
	    values.

<LI>Dates (see <A HREF="MEI.html#dataVerDate">Data Verifications section on Dates</A>)

<LI>Review? (see <A HREF="MEI.html#dataVerPulldown">Data Verifications section on Pulldown Menus</A>)

    Modifying this value will set the "Is Review Article?" flag in the MGD Master Bib record
    of the reference.

<OL>
<LI>Event; default is <I>assigned</I>
<LI>Status; default is <I>In Progress</I>
<LI>Submitted by; default is current user
<LI>Broadcast by; default is current user when user broadcasts symbol
<LI>Broadcast Date = today when user broadcasts symbol

<H4>Duplicates</H4>
(Remember:  Our database server is case-insensitive)
<OL>
<LI><I>Other Names</I> duplicates are disallowed.  Therefore, you cannot
    enter both <I>DokR</I> and <I>Dokr</I> as <I>Other Names</I>.  Only
    one of these values is allowed.
</OL>

<H4>Broadcasts to MGD</H4>
(Note:  Refer to <A HREF="http://prodwww/wts_projects/1200/1291/userrequirements.pdf">TR 1291 Requirements</A>
for definitions of Tier 3 and Tier 4 users and more details on each type of Broadcast.)
<P>
Tier 3 users can only broadcast symbols which they have submitted and which
have a status of <I>In Progress</I>.  Tier 4 users may broadcast any symbol <B>except</B>
a symbol with a status of <I>Broadcast</I>, <I>Approved</I> or <I>Deleted</I>.
<P>
For the <I>add and broadcast</I> options, if any errors are detected during the broadcast,
the symbol will still be added to Nomen.
<P>
When a broadcast to MGD is successful, the <I>Status</I>, <I>Broadcast by</I>,
<I>Broadcast Date</I>, and <I>MGI Accession ID</I> fields are automatically populated.  No
user can edit these fields manually.
<P>
<OL>
<LI><I>Add and Broadcast Official to MGD</I> - add symbol to Nomen and broadcast to MGD as <I>Official</I> in one step
<LI><I>Add and Broadcast Interim to MGD</I> - add symbol to Nomen and broadcast to MGD as <I>Interim</I> in one step
<LI><I>Broadcast Official Symbol to MGD</I> - broadcast one symbol to MGD and status as <I>Official</I>
<LI><I>Broadcast Interim Symbol to MGD</I> - broadcast one symbol to MGD and status as <I>Interim</I>
</OL>

<H4>Miscellaneous</H4>
<OL>
<LI>When the user adds either a <I>Primary</I> or <I>Related</I> Reference, the MGD Master 
    Bibliography record for that Reference will be updated so that the <I>Nomenclature</I> data 
    set is selected.
<P>
<LI>The <I>Symbol/Name Search</I> field is used for querying only.  When the user enters a value into
    this field and clicks <I>Search</I>, the system will take the search criteria entered and search
    the <I>Symbol</I> and <I>Name</I> fields for the value.  Search criteria entered in other form 
    fields are ignored when the <I>Symbol/Name Search</I> field is populated.
    <P>
    The search fields for <I>Symbol/Name Search</I> can be expanded to include Names and/or Notes.
<P>
<LI>To duplicate a record, select the record you want to duplicate and then de-select it.  The data
    fields will remain populated.  Make the changes necessary for the <I>new</I> record and click
    <I>Add</I>.  The new record will be added and will contain all of the information retained from
    the original record.  <I>Editor's Notes</I> and <I>Nomenclature Coordinator Notes</I> are
    <B>not</B> duplicated.
