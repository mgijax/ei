MGD EDITING INTERFACE: Design and Requirements - MLC
</H2>
<BR>

<H4>Introduction</H4>
MLC allows entry of phenotypic descriptions of MGD Markers.  MLC text provides
users with the ability to embed valid Markers and References within the text itself using a
simple markup mechanism.  When rendered on the Web, these embedded Markers and References
are hypertext-linked to a Marker detail and Reference list, respectively.
<P>
There are two sets of MLC tables:
	<UL>
	<LI>Production tables
	<LI>Edit tables
	</UL>
<P>
The MLC edit form modifies records in the Edit tables only.  These records are not moved over to
Production until the user specifically requests a transfer.  Therefore, at any given time, 
the status of an MLC record in Production may differ from the status of an MLC record viewed
in the editorial interface.
<P>
The one table which does not have a corresponding Edit table is the <I>MLC Classes</I> table.
In this case, modifications to MLC Class information is immediately propagated to Production,
while the rest of the modifications will be held in the Edit tables until explicitly propagated to Production.
<P>
Images for MLC records are scanned and stored in a Web installation documents directory.  A separate
index file is maintained for cross-referencing MLC symbols to their appropriate MLC images.  This mechanism
needs to be redesigned because:
	<UL>
	<LI>There is no way for the user to attach images to a specific MLC record.
	<LI>Nomenclature updates do not propagate to the MLC index file.
	</UL>

<P>
A proposal to fix the problems with handling of MLC Images has been composed.

<H4>Searches</H4>
All fields in the editing form are searchable.
 
<H4>Deletions</H4>
There are no restrictions on deleting an MLC record.

<H4>Record Locking</H4>
An MLC record is locked during editing so that no other users may edit the record
at the same time.  If an MLC record lock cannot be obtained, then the user will
receive an error message and will not be allowed to edit the MLC record:
	<PRE>
	The MLC Record you have chosen is currently being edited by another user,
	or you do not have the appropriate permissions to edit the MLC entries.
	</PRE>

Record locks are released when the user de-selects the current record, selects another
record, clears the form or exits the form.
<P>
If, for some reason, an MLC record has not been unlocked, the user can use the <I>Utilities->Unlock Record</I>
dialog to unlock a specific MLC record.  Records will not be unlocked if the user chooses the eXodus
<I>File->Quit</I> menu option.  Instead, the user should choose <I>File->Exit</I> from the MLC editing form
or click in the <I>close window key</I> in the upper left hand corner of the MLC editing form window.

<H4>Description Field Markups</H4>
The <I>Description</I> field can contain cross references to valid Marker symbols and References.
<OL>
<LI>To designate a Marker:
	<PRE>\L(symbol)</PRE>
    <P>
    Markers are verified upon modification.  Modifications are denied on invalid
    entries.

    NOTE:  All symbols which contain the "\L" markup will be automatically updated during
    nomenclature changes.
<P>
<LI>To designate an Allele:
	<PRE>\L(symbol)&lt;SUP&gt;allele&lt;/SUP&gt;</PRE>
<P>
<LI>To designate a Reference:

    <P>
    Reference tags correspond to the <I>Ref #</I> in the <I>Reference</I> table.
<P>
<LI>To designate headings on the Web, use &lt;H?&gt; where ? is a number from 1 to 6.

<H4>Description Field Error Checking</H4>
When the user hits the <I>Modify</I> key, the following error checks are performed.
All errors must be fixed before the user can successfully modify the MLC record.
<OL>
<LI>Duplicate References are checked.  If a Reference appears more than once in the Reference table,
    then the message <I>Duplicate Ref#(s):</I> with a listing of the Reference numbers which are
    duplicates is displayed.
<P>
<LI>All markup is valided.
	<UL>
	<LI>If bad or disallowed markup is found,, then the
	    message <I>Bad/Disallowed markup using { or } or other invalid characters. Edit and resubmit.</I>
	    is displayed.
	<P>
	<LI>If unmatched brackets &lt;&gt; or parentheses () are found, then the
	    message <I>Unmatched &lt;&gt; or parentheses.  Edit and re-submit.</I> is 
	    displayed.
	<P>
	</UL>
<P>
<LI>All Marker symbols in <CODE>\L(symbol)</CODE> markup are validated against the database.
    If any errors are detected, a table of Symbol Errors is displayed with the following
    fields:
    <UL>
    <LI>Symbol
    <LI>Reason
    <LI>New Symbol(s)
    </UL>
    <P>
    <I>Reason</I> values are:
    <UL>
    <LI><I>NOT_IN_MGD</I>, the symbol is not a valid symbol.  
	These errors must be fixed directly within the <I>Description</I> field.
    <P>
    <LI><I>NOT_CURRENT</I>, the symbol is withdrawn.
        These errors can be fixed by selecting the appropriate Symbol line
        in the Symbol Errors dialog and clicking <I>Fix</I>.  This will replace the withdrawn
        symbol in the <I>Description</I> field with the current symbol displayed in the <I>Selection</I>
	text.  Edits to the <I>Selection</I> text are ignored.
    <P>
    <LI><I>SPLIT</I>, the symbol is withdrawn and has been split into more than one new symbol.
        These errors can be fixed by selecting the appropriate Symbol line
        in the Symbol Errors dialog and clicking <I>Fix</I>.  This will replace the withdrawn
        symbol in the <I>Description</I> field with the current symbol(s) displayed in the <I>Selection</I>
	text.  Edits to the <I>Selection</I> text are ignored.
    </UL>
<P>
<LI>
<P>
</OL>

<H4>Transferring to Production</H4>
<I>After</I> Adding or Modifying an MLC edit record, the record can be 
transferred to Production by selecting <I>Utilities->Submit Data to 
Production</I>. This will immediately transfer the <I>currently 
selected</I> MLC record to the Production database:
<PRE>
	You are about to transfer the current record to the 
	MLC Production Database.  If you have deleted the current
	record, then this same delete will occur on Production.
	Select "Yes" to confirm, "No" to cancel.
</PRE>
<P>
A deleted record must be re-selected before selecting <I>Utilities->Submit 
Data to Production</I>. Until the delete is submitted to Production, the 
record you have deleted in the Edit tables will persist in the Production 
tables and will be visible via the Production web interface. 

<H4>Classes</H4>
MLC Class modifications <B>are</B> transferred to Production <B>immediately</B> upon modification of the record.

<H4>Miscellaneous</H4>
<OL>
<LI>To import a text description from another Marker symbol into the current record, use the
    <I>Utilities->Import Description</I> dialog.
<P>
<LI>A global search and replace mechanism is available for the <I>Description</I> field.
    An <I>Undo</I> button allows the user to back out the most recent search and replace.

<P>
<LI>To view all Reference markup tags which do not have a corresponding Reference,
    click on the <I>Miss</I> button.
<P>
<LI>To view all References which do not have a corresponding Reference markup tag,
    click on the <I>Extra</I> button.  An asterisk will appear in the <I>Ref#</I> column.
<P>
<LI>To alphabetically sort all References, click on the <I>Sort</I> button.
<P>
<LI>If a user makes modifications to an MLC record and de-selects the record or selects another
    record without saving the modifications, then an error message is displayed:
	<PRE>
	You have made changes to the data associated with the current symbol.
	Commit changes or Clear before selecting a new symbol to edit.
	</PRE>
    The user must save the changes or clear the form before being able to continue.
<P>
<LI>If a user makes modifications to an MLC record and tries to exit the form
    without saving the modifications, then a message is displayed:
	<PRE>
	Changes have not been saved!
	Are you sure you want to exit this form?
	</PRE>
    If the user answers <I>Yes</I>, then the changes are not commited and the form exits.
    If the user answers <I>No</I>, then the user is returned to the form and the current record.
