	<TD>Having problems logging into the new Nomen interface. I never get the
	    Sybase login screen after entering my unix name and password.
	<TD>03/18/1999; let
	<TD>Fixed
	<TD>Lori
	<TD>Laura did not have the most recent eXodus Connections fix.

	<TD>Manual Broadcast is not creating a file in the correct format.
	<TD>03/18/1999; djr
	<TD>Fixed
	<TD>Lori
	<TD>For some reason, the installed MGD is not recognizing the latest Broadcast change.
	    Will have to re-install the MGD Editing interface.

<TR bgcolor="#00FF00">
	<TD>Unintentional double-clicks during Broadcast file generation can overwrite
	    the "good" Broadcast file with an empty one.
	<TD>03/18/1999; mgm
	<TD>Fixed
	<TD>Lori
	<TD>Two things:  1) document steps to safeguard against this
	    2) have broadcast generation script save a copy of any previously
	       existing broadcast files with the same prefix before creating new ones.

<TR bgcolor="#00FF00">
	<TD>Incorrect label in Broadcast dialog.  First <I>Broadcast File Name</I> should
	    read <I>Preview File Name</I>.

<TR bgcolor="#CC9999">
	<TD>Search of Approved Name in Symbol/Name search for Kcnc1 gene doesn't
	    return the record.
	<TD>03/18/1999; rmb
	<TD>No bug
	<TD>Lori
	<TD>In MGD, the name is 'potassium voltage gated channel...'.  In Nomen, the
	    name is 'potassium voltage-gated channel...'.  Notice the dash between
	    'voltage' and 'gated' in the Nomen name.

<TR bgcolor="#00FF00">
	<TD>User attempted to manually enter Gene Family information instead of
	    using the Gene Family lookup list.  Syntax error during add.

	<TD>03/19/1999; rmb
	<TD>Fixed
	<TD>Lori
	<TD>Emailed John and asked him to add permissions.

	<TD>Add message "All information associated with a RESERVED symbol is strictly CONFIDENTIAL"
	    to the Nomen form.
	<TD>03/23/1999; ljm
	<TD>Modification request
	<TD>Lori
	<TD>Installed.

<TR bgcolor="#00FF00">
	<TD>The <I>MRK_Nomen_Other</I> table needs a unique index on <I>_Nomen_key</I>
	    and <I>name</I> to prevent duplication of Other Names.  This will cause problems
	    in the MGD Broadcast.  However, this index cannot be created without redefining
	    <I>MRK_Nomen_Other.name</I> from a <I>varchar(255)</I> to a <I>varchar(200)</I>
	    (see TR 449).
	<TD>03/25/1999; lec
	<TD>Fixed
	<TD>Lori/John
	<TD>John will make the necessary schema change in Nomen and then create the index.
	    <BR>
	    Lori will verify that no duplicates currently exist in <I>MRK_Nomen_Other</I>.

<TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
	<TD>Make "Reserved" toggle Yellow so that it catches the user's eye.

	<TD>Modification request; in progress
	<TD>Lori
	<TD>&nbsp;

<TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
	<TD>Change all non-approved, non-broadcast, reserved symbol chromosome values
	    from RE to UN.
	<TD>03/25/1999; ljm
	<TD>Modification request
	<TD>Lori
	<TD>Installed.

<TR bgcolor="#00FF00">
	<TD>Modification of "Broadcast" to "Approved" did not work properly.
	<TD>03/29/1999; lec
	<TD>Fixed
	<TD>Lori
	<TD>Trigger was tripping over itself; need conditional statements in <I>MRK_Nomen_Update</I>

<TR bgcolor="#00FF00">
	<TD>VerifyNomenSymbol event tabbing seems to accumulate tabs...narrowed this down to
	    user closing form by using upper left-hand click-box and not File->Exit.
	<TD>04/02/1999; lec, mgm
	<TD>Fixed
	<TD>Lori
	<TD>File->Exit calls form's local Exit event.  Click-box calls global ExitWindow event only.
	    The local Exit event destroys the form object...ExitWindow does NOT.  This seems to
	    fix the problem.  User to test.  See TR 462.

<TR bgcolor="#00FF00">
	<TD>Symbol <I>Lats1</I> does not seem to have any detail information with it.
	<TD>04/07/1999; mgm

	<TD>Lori
	<TD>Data migration.  7 symbols migrated with a _Marker_Event_key of -1.  These were
	    updated to "New".  Symbols are:  grt, Vax2, Gng10, Gng12, Ppp2ca, Ppp2cb, Lats1.
