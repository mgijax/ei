MGI EDITING INTERFACE: Design and Requirements - Organism
</H2>
<BR>

<H4>Introduction</H4>
The master list of Organism contains the Latin and common names for over 75 mammalian organism.  Data sets
which cross reference to the master Organism list are:
	<UL>
	<LI>Molecular Probes & Segment Libraries (Sources)
	<LI>Orthology
	</UL>
<P>
The master Organism list also cross-references a Chromosome Order table.  This table provides an
ordered list of all chromosomes for a given organism.  Ordering of chromosomes is essential for 
creating reports and constructing the Oxford Grid.
<P>
In addition, the Organism <I>mouse, laboratory</I> cross-references a list of <I>Anchor loci</I>.
<I>Anchor loci</I> are loci that have been well-defined and well-mapped on their chromosome. These loci 
are used to construct the Web mini-maps on the Marker detail screen.

<H4>Deletions</H4>
A Organism cannot be deleted if it is referenced by a:
<OL>
<LI>Marker
<LI>Molecular Probe & Segment
<LI>Orthology
</OL>

<H4>Miscellaneous</H4>
<OL>
<LI>The <I>MGI Types for Which This Organism is Valid</I> is used to
    define the organisms relevant for each MGI Type. The EI uses
    these definitions to build the Organsim pulldown option lists in the
    Antibody, Antigen, Marker, Orthology, Molecular Segments and Sequence EI modules.
<P>
<LI>Anchor Loci are only relevant for <I>mouse, laboratory</I>.
