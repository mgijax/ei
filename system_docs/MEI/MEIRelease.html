MGI EDITING INTERFACE - Release Process
</H2>

<H4>Purpose</H4>
This document provides procedures for preparing and installing a release of an
Editing Interface Application (MGD, GXD, Nomenclature, MGI Admin).
<P>
Read <A HREF="../MGIREADME.html">MGI EDITING INTERFACE - Overview</A> before
reading this document.  The overview document contains definitions and other terms which
will are also used in this document.

<H4>Release Procedures</H4>
<OL>
<LI>Email <CODE>info-mgi</CODE> to inform everyone in the group of the pending release.
    Include the following information:
    <UL>
    <LI>Ask everyone to exit the application by a certain time prior to installing the new release.
    <LI>Ask everyone to refrain from entering the application again until you have sent
	additional email informing them that the release has been successfully installed.
    <LI>Try to give an approximate time for when the new release will be available.
    </UL>
<P>
<LI>Check the <A HREF="MEI.html#logs">user logs</A>.  At least once a year, the logs should
    be backed up to tape (see Ruth) and then removed so that new logs are created.  As the logs
    get bigger and bigger, it can be awkward to load them into an editor so that they can be
    read when debugging problems.
<P>
<LI>Check <CODE>titan</CODE> to verify that there are no editing sessions running for the
    application being released.  For example, to determine if any MGD applications are
    currently running:
    <PRE>
    titan> ps -ef | grep runmgd
    </PRE>
    <P>
    If there are applications still running and you are ready to build the release, either
    kill the processes (you must be <CODE>root</CODE>) or contact the user and ask him/her to
    exit the application.
<P>
<LI><A HREF="../MGIREADME.html#buildComp">Build and install a Production copy of the application.</A>
<P>
<LI><A HREF="../MGIREADME.html#runMGI">Run the installed application.</A>
<P>
<LI>Once you are confident that the release has been installed successfully, 
    email <CODE>info-mgi</CODE> and inform everyone in the group that the application
    can be used.
