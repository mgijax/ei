<H2>GXD Expression Cache</H2>

<H4>Introduction</H4>
 
The GXD Expression Cache table (GXD_Expression) contains redundant information of expression 
results which will be used to make the most common kinds of Web queries more efficient.
<P>
Every time an Assay record is modified (general Assay info, Probe/Antibody Preparation, In Situ 
details, Gel details), the cache will be modified to reflect the changes in the given Assay.
<P>

<H4>The Algorithm</H4>
The original algorithm is specified in the GXD Schema 1.0 document (1/22/1998), page 25.
<P>
<PRE>
 If Assay is a Gel:
   For each Gel Lane:
     If Gel Lane is not a Control:
       If any Gel Bands in the Gel Lane have strength != "Absent":
         expressed = yes
       Else:
         expressed = no
       For each Structure associated with Gel Lane:
         Insert record into cache table
 Else If Assay is InSitu:
   For each Specimen:
     For each Specimen Result:
       For each Structure associated with Result:
         If any Result has strength != "Absent" and != "Not Applicable":
           expressed = yes
         Else:
           expressed = no
         Insert record into cache table
</PRE>

<H4>Design & Implementation</H4>
The load of the GXD Expression Cache table (GXD_Expression) will be handled by a stored procedure 
executed from the insert/update trigger of the main Assay table (GXD_Assay). Every time an Assay 
detail record is modified, the modification date of the main Assay table will be modified, which 
will trigger the load of the Expression Cache table.
<P>
(The update of the main Assay table's modification date is not handled within individual 
triggers because this would cause mulitiple calls to the main Assay table's triggers
which are unnecessary. Instead, the Modify callback within the TeleUSE D code will handle this 
update.)
<P>
The Assay detail tables which trigger an update to the Cache table are:
<OL>
<LI>GXD_AntibodyPrep 
<LI>GXD_ProbePrep 
<LI>GXD_Specimen 
<LI>GXD_InSituResult 
<LI>GXD_ISResultStructure 
<LI>GXD_GelLane 
<LI>GXD_GelRow 
<LI>GXD_GelBand 
<LI>GXD_GelLaneStructure 
<LI>GXD_Genotype 
</OL>
<P>
The stored procedure <I>GXD_loadCacheByAssay</I> will load the Expression cache table for a 
given Assay key. 
<P>
The stored procedure <I>GXD_loadCacheAll</I> will load the Expression cache table for all 
Assays in the database.
