<H2>MGI: NLM Update</H2>

<H4>Introduction</H4>
Reference information is added to MGD in two ways:
	<OL>
	<LI>Manual add by data staff followed by automated update from NLM file.
	<LI>Automated add from NLM file.
	</OL>
During manual entry of a Reference in MGD, only a minimum of information is entered.  The
full reference information is updated on a regular basis from the National Library of Medicine (NLM).
A Web version of NLM is maintained by NCBI/PubMed. This site provides an electronic interface to
references and can be used to search and download files in MEDLINE format for processing.
<P>
The information from NLM/PubMed is used to add references to MGD or to update an existing MGD
reference.  The following Reference fields in MGD are modified directly from NLM information:
<OL>
<LI>Authors
<LI>Title
<LI>Medline Accession number
<LI>Abstract
<LI>Date
<LI>Volume
<LI>Issue
<LI>Pages
</OL>

<H4>The Data Input Files</H4>
<OL>
<LI>The input files from NLM are generated from the NCBI NLM/PubMed site 
    <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed</A> using the MEDLINE display format.
    These files should be saved to the user's UNIX home directory so they can be accessed by
    the EI.  For complete instructions on creating a NLM input file from NCBI, see..).
    <P>
    <B>Note:</B>:  It is very important that users do <B>not</B> edit the files
       which are downloaded from NCBI NLM/PubMed.
</OL>

<H4>Initiating the NLM Update</H4>
<OL>
<LI>Bring up the <A HREF="reference.gif">MGD Reference Editing Form</A>.
<LI>Click <I>NLM</I> to bring up the <A HREF="nlm.gif">NLM dialog</A>.
<LI>Enter the name of the NLM input file in the dialog <I>Selection</I> field using the <I>Filter</I>
    and <I>Files</I> listing to select the appropriate file.
<LI>Click on the desired <B>mode</B> to initiate the NLM Update.
<LI>If the users selects <I>Add NLM</I>, then the <I>Starting J#</I> field will automatically
    be populated with the next available J#.  The user can override this value, but transactions
    which attempt to use duplicate J#s will be denied.
</OL>

There are 2 modes defined for processing NLM data files:
<OL>
<LI><I>Update NLM</I> mode updates MGD References from an NLM input file.
<LI><I>Add NLM</I> mode inserts MGD References from an NLM input file.
<P>
</OL>

<H4>Update Algorithm</H4>
<OL>
<LI>MGD is searched for a match to a NLM record using the following criteria:
        <UL>
        <LI>Journal
        <LI>Year
        <LI>Volume
        <LI>First Page
        </UL>
<P>
<LI>If one match is found, then the database is also searched for a possible Submission reference
    using:
    <UL>
    <LI>Journal = Submission
    <LI>Primary Author
    <LI>first 25 characters of Title
    </UL>
<P>
<LI>If one match is found and no Submission reference is found and the Medline UI, Title or 
    Abstract is blank, then the MGD record is updated with the full NLM Reference information:
    <UL>
    <LI>Authors
    <LI>Title
    <LI>Medline Accession number
    <LI>Abstract
    <LI>Date
    <LI>Volume
    <LI>Issue
    <LI>Pages
    </UL>
<P>
<LI>If more than one match is found, then the NLM reference is reported as a "duplicate".
<P>
<LI>If a match to a Submission record is found, then the NLM reference is reported as
    a "duplicate" and the message "SUBMISSION FOUND IN MGD" is recorded.
<P>
<LI>If no match is found, then the NLM reference is reported as "nomatch".
<P>
<LI>If any required information is missing in the NLM record, then the NLM reference is 
    reported as "nomatch" and a message explaining what data field is missing is recorded.
<P>
</OL>

<H4>Add Algorithm</H4>
<OL>
<LI>MGD is searched for a match to a NLM record using the following criteria:
        <UL>
        <LI>Journal
        <LI>Year
        <LI>Volume
        <LI>First Page
        </UL>
<P>
<LI>If a match is found, then the NLM reference is reported as a "duplicate".
<P>
<LI>If no match is found, then the NLM reference is added and reported as an "add".
<P>
</OL>

<H4>Output from the NLM Update</H4>

The NLM process outputs several files.  These files are output into
the user's <CODE>$HOME</CODE> directory.

<OL>
<LI><I>&lt;inputfile&gt;.diagnostics</I>
    <P>Diagnostic listing of all SQL generated during processing.
       This file is for SEs to debug any problems.
<P>
<LI><I>&lt;inputfile&gt;.duplicates</I>
    <P>Listing of all References which contain duplicate entries in MGD.
       Listing of all References for which a Submission reference was found in MGD.
       This file is in the same format as the input file.
<P>
<LI><I>&lt;inputfile&gt;.nomatch</I>
    <P>Listing of all References in the input file for which no match could be found in MGD.
       This file is in the same format as the input file.
<P>
<LI><I>&lt;inputfile&gt;.added</I>
    <P>Listing of all References in the input file which were added to the database during
       the Add process.
       This file is in the same format as the input file with the addition of the J# assignment 
       for each record.
<P>
</OL>

<H4>Source Code</H4>
The NLM source programs are:
<OL>
<LI>Production:  <CODE>titan:/usr/local/mgi/ei/mgd/nlm.py</CODE>
    <BR>
    Development:  <CODE>utilities/nlm.py</CODE>
    <P>
    Main program.
