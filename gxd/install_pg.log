Unused variables cause inefficiency or may be an error

Variables do consume some space overhead and initialization 
time, so you may want to eliminate those that are no longer 
used. In addition, sometimes the presence of an unused 
variable indicates an error (for example, if the wrong 
variable was used or assigned).

Unused variables cause inefficiency or may be an error

Variables do consume some space overhead and initialization 
time, so you may want to eliminate those that are no longer 
used. In addition, sometimes the presence of an unused 
variable indicates an error (for example, if the wrong 
variable was used or assigned).

Unused variables cause inefficiency or may be an error

Variables do consume some space overhead and initialization 
time, so you may want to eliminate those that are no longer 
used. In addition, sometimes the presence of an unused 
variable indicates an error (for example, if the wrong 
variable was used or assigned).

Unused variables cause inefficiency or may be an error

Variables do consume some space overhead and initialization 
time, so you may want to eliminate those that are no longer 
used. In addition, sometimes the presence of an unused 
variable indicates an error (for example, if the wrong 
variable was used or assigned).

Unused variables cause inefficiency or may be an error

Variables do consume some space overhead and initialization 
time, so you may want to eliminate those that are no longer 
used. In addition, sometimes the presence of an unused 
variable indicates an error (for example, if the wrong 
variable was used or assigned).
